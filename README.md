This is a simple movie recommendation system that uses cosine similarity to recommend movies based on their genres, keywords, and overview. The system processes metadata from popular movie datasets and allows users to find movies similar to their favorite titles. It utilizes TF-IDF Vectorization and cosine similarity for computing recommendations. The system outputs the top 10 most similar movies, along with their genres.
